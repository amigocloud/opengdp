Initial version of MOD_PRDS
Liam Gumley

This version of the MODIS L1B destriping algorithm is based on the IDL version
that has been running at CIMSS on direct broadcast since June 2003. The 
algorithm is reliable and fast in the IDL implementation.

The algorithm is based on Weinreb et al., 1989: “Destriping GOES Images by 
Matching Empirical Distribution Functions”. Remote Sens. Environ., 29, 
185-195.

1. Algorithm Details
- Accounts for both detector-to-detector and mirror side striping.
- MODIS is treated as a 20 detector instrument in the thermal emissive bands
 (10 detectors on each mirror side).
- The empirical distribution function (EDF) is computed for each detector
 (cumulative histogram of relative frequency).
- The EDF for each detector is adjusted to match the EDF of a reference 
  in-family detector.
- Algorithm operates on L1B scaled integers (0-32767).
- Median scaled integer value for each band is restored following destriping.

2. Terra and Aqua MODIS Implementation in FORTRAN-90
- Correction LUT is created for each individual granule on the fly.
- Uncorrected scaled integers are replaced with corrected scaled integers.
- Impact on bands 31 and 32 is equivocal.
- For Terra MODIS, noisy detectors in some bands are replaced with neighbors.
- For Aqua MODIS, no detectors are replaced.
- Requires less than 60 seconds to run for each granule.
- Text configuration file (one each for Terra and Aqua) defines
  (a) which bands will be destriped
  (b) which detector will be the reference for each band
  (c) which detectors will be replaced for each band

3. Impact on the L1B 1KM data
- For most of the thermal infrared bands, the impact is positive. Striping noise
  is significantly reduced, and this has a positive impact on downstream 
  products such as the cloudmask, atmospheric profiles, and cloud top 
  properties.
- For bands 31 and 32, the impact is equivocal. However, for cloud top phase
  computations involving differences between bands 31, 32, and 29, the impact
  appears to be positive.
- NOTE: The L1B 1KM file is irreversibly changed by this algorithm. It is 
  possible, but complicated, to implement this algorithm in such a way that the
  destriping is reversible.
